## Overview
### Description
[Summarizes audiobooks, news articles, podcasts, research papers -> then be able to see bias on the piece of media using machine learning to see what side or how neutral the media truly is or claims to be. All media has bias no matter how neutral it seems to be and we are trying to expose this bias via machine learning, without any human bias being involved.]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: productivity/lifestyle**
- **Mobile: iOS**
- **Story: Seeing how people today have very little time to read media, our app help to minimize their time reading these long pieces of media by summarizing media while showing users the underlying bias that these pieces of media try to portray. Our peers who are intrested in reading/listening to media will be respond positively to our product idea.**
- **Market: : Our target audience is users who dont have times to read or listen to media but still want to access the information presented in these media, therefore we believe the size and scale of your potential users is pretty big. Our app is designed for a genral purposes that helps solve a problem for a large group of users, but is not valuable to a niche group of users. We have a well defined audience for our app.**
- **Habit: Ideally users will use the app once or twice a day, we want to promate the idea of building a habit of redeang the news, and users would consume not create with our app.**
- **Scope: The scope for the app is pretty well defined as we know what features we want to implement into the app and how the app will work at its core. The app will be technically challanging due to the additions of features which will involve machine learning and bias detection. The app at its core, stripped down, summarizes media which in itself is not as interesting as the app with the feature to detect bias.**
