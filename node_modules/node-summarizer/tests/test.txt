Blake Griffin didn’t say much Saturday about the left knee injury that forced him to miss four of the final seven games of the regular season.

“We’re taking this day by day,” he said when asked about his availability for the Detroit Pistons' playoff opener against the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday. “I’m not looking forward to a day that’s not right here in front of me.

“I’ll sit with our training staff and whoever else needs to be in on that decision and make that call.”

If the game were Saturday night, could Griffin go?
“It’s not Saturday night,” Griffin said.

An official status report lists Griffin as questionable, but it’s apparent the Pistons are preparing to be without Griffin — at least for the beginning of the best-of-seven first-round series against the league’s best team.

“When you lose him and don’t have him going into Game 1, it’s a huge blow, but we are going to step up, defensively, offensively in all the areas with him not being there,” point guard Ish Smith said.

The Pistons were 2-5 in games Griffin didn’t play, so even winning one game against the league’s best team will be tough.

Griffin played in 75 games during the regular season, the most he’s played since the 2013-14 season.

He tweaked his left knee toward the end of the season, and he took himself out of the lineup after warmups before the Pistons’ 99-90 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on March 30.

He missed the next two games before returning to score 45 points at Oklahoma City in a road loss April 5. But he struggled mightily the next two games, culminating in only five points in 18 minutes in Tuesday night’s 100-93 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the regular-season home finale.

He missed the season finale at the New York Knicks, the night the Pistons clinched a playoff spot.

Griffin, 30, was an All-Star and averaged 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game this season.

Before speaking with reporters Saturday, Griffin walked on a treadmill at the practice facility in Auburn Hills. After finishing, he spoke briefly with Pistons public relations personnel before addressing the media.

He’s been receiving treatment almost nonstop the past couple days, and it’s obvious he’s determined to return to the floor, but he also expressed satisfaction with reaching the postseason, establishing a foundation in coach Dwane Casey’s first season.

“You never want to let your teammates down and not be out there, but at the same time we’ve built a foundation this season and we’ve started to play the right brand of basketball,” Griffin said. “Those types of things carry over.

“Our goal was the reach the playoffs and we accomplished that goal so at the end of the day, we’re right where we want to be.”
